The Bootstrap directory typically contains the following folders:

1. **CSS Folder**:
    - Contains precompiled CSS files such as `bootstrap.css` and `bootstrap.min.css`.
    - Purpose: Provides styles for the layout, typography, components, and utilities of a website.

2. **JS Folder**:
    - Contains JavaScript files like `bootstrap.js` and `bootstrap.min.js`.
    - Purpose: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to Bootstrap components (e.g., modals, tooltips, carousels).

3. **Icons Folder**:
    - Contains SVG files or icon-related resources.
    - Purpose: Provides a collection of scalable vector icons for use in web projects.

These folders collectively enable developers to build responsive and interactive web applications using Bootstrap.
